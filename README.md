## About TMF
The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre developed this new dataset on forest cover change in tropical moist forests (TMF) using 38 years of Landsat time series.   

The wall-to-wall maps at 0.09 ha resolution (30m) depict the TMF extent and the related disturbances (deforestation and degradation), and post-deforestation recovery (or forest regrowth) through two complementary thematic layers: a transition map and an annual change collection over the period 1990-2019.  

Each disturbance (deforestation or degradation) is characterized by its timing and intensity. 

Deforestation refers to a change in land cover (from forest to non-forested land) when degradation refers to a temporary disturbance in a forest remaining forested such as selective logging, fires and unusual weather events (hurricanes, droughts, blowdown).
